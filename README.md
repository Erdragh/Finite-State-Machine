Implementation of a deterministic automaton in JAVA that I made for school
## can I use this?
If you can find a reason for it and it works, feel free to do so. You can report any issues on the Issues tab here on GitHub. If I have the time and energy to work on it I will try my best. If anyone wants to contribute to this, feel free to do so.
## how to contribute?
Honestly, I am new to all of this. All I can give you is what I worked with:

- VSCode with the Java Extension Pack
- [This: the JSON-java library](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) to read my `language.json` file
- I don't know if you'll have to add the folder to the Source Path in VSCode manually. I hope you won't. Good luck.

I thank you a lot if you can bring yourself to contribute to this software.
